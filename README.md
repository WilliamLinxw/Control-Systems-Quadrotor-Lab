# Control-Systems-Quadrotor-Lab
Project codes for the Quadrotor project of Control Systems at ETH Zurich

In these projects, we linearized the quadrotor dynamic model, performed system analysis on the linearized model, designed controllers and varified them using MATLAB. Finally, the well-tuned Lead-Lag controller in simulation was verified on the Crazyflie quadrotors platform.
